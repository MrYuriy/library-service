# Library Management System
This is a project to develop an online management system for book borrowings in a library. 
The system aims to optimize the work of library administrators and provide a user-friendly experience for customers. 
It will automate the tracking of books, borrowings, users, and 
payments, eliminating the need for manual paper-based processes.

## Project Description
The library management system will address the following issues in the current manual system:

- Lack of book inventory tracking
- Inability to check availability of specific books
- Cash-only payments without credit card support
- Manual tracking of book returns and late returns

To overcome these problems, we will develop an online system that allows users to borrow 
books, make payments, and receive notifications. 
The system will enable administrators to manage books, track borrowings, and
receive updates about new borrowings, overdue books, and successful payments.
